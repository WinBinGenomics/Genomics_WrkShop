this directory contains scripts to: 
Step 0) Split the VCF by population and then filtering for biallelic sites with a maf = 0.05
Step 1) Convert VCF files (three chromosomes per pop - six total) to plink (.ped and .map) format. This step requires users to edit the .map files with 
        awk command found on the bottom of the script to add chromosome identifier per map file! IMPORTANT TO DO BEFORE MERGE.
Step 2) Merge PLINK files per population. Uses plinks merge option which requires binary input. Therfore, the script also reverts the end product to 
        .ped (nonbinary format)
step 3) Gone2 Runner. Uses deafault gone settings. 
Step 3.1) Plots the first 50 generations of gone output per population. 
Step 4) Runs currentne2 using default setting.
